# Action-RPG


This is intended to be used in an Action RPG (think Diablo, Path of Exile, Torchlight etc.).
Traditionally, in these games, the player will kill enemies and enemies have a chance to drop loot. For our purposes, I assumed enemies only drop armour.

I refractored code, used design patters such as factory and decorator, created UML diagrams, and overall used SOLID design principles throughout the process.
